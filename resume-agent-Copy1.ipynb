    "\n",
    "This project implements a multi-agent system using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). The pipeline automates resume tailoring by combining:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resume Intake Agent** – extracts and standardizes resume content  \n",
    "2. **Job Research Agent** – performs live search to identify real job requirements  \n",
    "3. **Resume Rewrite Agent** – merges resume + job insights into a tailored final resume  \n",
    "4. **Polishing Agent** – refines clarity, style, and conciseness\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent has a well-defined responsibility and hands its output to the next step. The final result is a fully rewritten, job-tailored resume with an explanation of the model’s decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates how LLM-powered agents can collaborate to automate real-world workflows, remove ambiguity, and produce consistently high-quality results.\n",

       "    *   **Efficiency Gains:** Clearly stated the \"15% overall speed improvement\" from your Python ETL jobs, proving your ability to optimize processes.\n",
       "    *   **Modern Development Practices:** Mentioning \"automated integration tests using pytest and GitHub Actions\" highlights familiarity with CI/CD, code quality, and automated testing, which are essential for Tesla's rapid development cycles.\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Leadership and Initiative:**\n",
       "    *   **Leadership Skills:** Quantified team size (6 students) and detailed management responsibilities (roadmap, standups, code reviews) to illustrate leadership potential and project management experience.\n",
       "    *   **Proactive Problem-Solving:** The hackathon win is presented as a significant achievement that showcases initiative, the ability to tackle real-world problems (wildfire risk), and deliver a functional solution.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **Formatting and Keywords:**\n",
       "    *   **Readability:** Ensured a clean, professional, and easy-to-scan format with distinct sections and clear bullet points.\n",
       "    *   **ATS Optimization:** Strategically integrated keywords from Tesla's job descriptions throughout the resume (e.g., C++, Python, Go, distributed systems, data pipelines, machine learning, software engineering, algorithms, data structures, full-stack, robotics, automation, simulation, scalability, performance optimization).\n",
       "    *   **Contact Information:** Placed essential contact details, including links to LinkedIn and GitHub, prominently at the top.\n",
